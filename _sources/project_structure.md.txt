# What’s in This Template Project?

> 🐍 This project is designed for a **Python-based code repository**. It includes features to help you manage, test, document, and share your code.

Below is an overview of the files and folders you’ll find in the `template-project`, along with what they do and why they’re useful. If you're new to GitHub or Python packaging, this is your orientation.

The tags above give an indication of what parts of this template project are used for what purposes, where:
- `# [core]` – Scientific core logic or core functions used across the project.
<!--- `# [api]` – Public-facing functions or modules users are expected to import and use.-->
- `# [docs]` – Documentation sources, configs, and assets for building project docs.
- `# [test]` – Automated tests for validating functionality.
- `# [demo]` – Notebooks and minimal working examples for demos or tutorials.
- `# [data]` – Sample or test data files.
- `# [ci]` – Continuous integration setup (GitHub Actions).
- `# [style]` – Configuration for code style, linting, and formatting.
- `# [meta]` – Project metadata (e.g., citation info, license, README).

**Note:** There are also files that you may end up generating but which don't necessarily appear in the project on GitHub.com (due to being ignored by your `.gitignore`).  These may include your environment (`venv/`, if you use pip and virtual environments), distribution files `dist/` for building packages to deploy on http://pypi.org, `htmlcov/` for coverage reports for tests, `template_project_efw.egg-info` for editable installs (e.g., `pip install -e .`).

## 🔍 Notes

- **Modularity**: Code is split by function (reading, writing, tools).
- **Logging**: All major functions support structured logging to `logs/`.
- **Tests**: Pytest-compatible tests are in `tests/`, with one file per module.
- **Docs**: Sphinx documentation is in `docs/`.

## 🔰 The Basics (Always Included)

- **`README.md`** – The first thing people see when they visit your GitHub repo. Use this to explain what your project is, how to install it, and how to get started.
- **`LICENSE`** – Explains what others are allowed to do with your code. This template uses the **MIT License**:
  - ✅ Very permissive — allows commercial and private use, modification, and distribution.
  - 🔗 More license info: [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)
- **`.gitignore`** – Tells Git which files/folders to ignore (e.g., system files, data outputs).
- **`requirements.txt`** – Lists the Python packages your project needs to run.

---

## 🧰 Python Packaging and Development

- **`pyproject.toml`** – A modern configuration file for building, installing, and describing your package (e.g. name, author, dependencies).
- **`requirements-dev.txt`** – Additional tools for developers (testing, linting, formatting, etc.).
- **`template_project/`** – Your main code lives here. Python will treat this as an importable module.
- **`pip install -e .`** – Lets you install your project locally in a way that updates as you edit files.

---

## 🧪 Testing and Continuous Integration

- **`tests/`** – Folder for test files. Use these to make sure your code works as expected.
- **`.github/workflows/`** – GitHub Actions automation:
  - `tests.yml` – Runs your tests automatically when you push changes.
  - `docs.yml` – Builds your documentation to check for errors.
  - `docs_deploy.yml` – Publishes documentation to GitHub Pages.
  - `pypi.yml` – Builds and uploads a release to PyPI when you tag a new version.

---

## 📝 Documentation

- **`docs/`** – Contains Sphinx and Markdown files to build your documentation site.
  - Run `make html` or use GitHub Actions to generate a website.
- **`.vscode/`** – Optional settings for Visual Studio Code (e.g., interpreter paths).
- **`notebooks/`** – A place to keep example Jupyter notebooks.

---

## 🧾 Metadata and Community

- **`CITATION.cff`** – Machine-readable citation info. Lets GitHub generate a "Cite this repository" button.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** – Guidelines for contributing to the project. Useful if you welcome outside help.
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** – Configuration for running automated checks (e.g., code formatting) before each commit.

---

## ✅ Summary

This template is a starting point for research or open-source Python projects. It supports:
- Clean project structure
- Reproducible environments
- Easy testing
- Auto-publishing documentation
- Optional packaging for PyPI

> 💡 Use what you need. Delete what you don’t. This is your scaffold for doing good, shareable science/code.
