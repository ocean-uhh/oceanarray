"""Single netCDF writer for oceanarray processing stages.

One :func:`write` seam replaces the six write paths the stages used before
(three via seasenselib's ``NetCdfWriter``, three via bare ``to_netcdf``).  It
reproduces seasenselib's attribute and name handling — dict attributes to JSON,
slash names to underscores — and cleans attributes: a ``None`` value is dropped
with a warning (never written as ``""``).  Every numeric variable with at least
one dimension, coordinates included, is written with zlib level 4 and the shuffle
filter.

Every ``datetime64`` variable is pinned to ``seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00``,
float64, ``proleptic_gregorian`` (``_TIME_ENCODING``) rather than xarray's
per-file guess.  Decoded instants are unchanged; raw stored values change.
