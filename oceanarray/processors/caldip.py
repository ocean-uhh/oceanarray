"""CalDip calibration-dip contract and interface for the front of Stage 3 (stub).

caldip is a separate package that compares mooring instruments against a shipboard CTD at
bottle stops and writes one netCDF per cast (``{cast}_caldip.nc``); the statistics CSV is a
derived export that oceanarray does not read. oceanarray reads that netCDF, matches instruments
by serial, and applies per-variable offsets at the front of Stage 3, before pressure
interpolation.

**Status: the correction is not implemented here.** This module carries only the *contract*
(the constants and serial join-key rule both packages share) and the *interface* the correction
is built to: :func:`read_caldip_cast`, :func:`find_caldip_casts`, :func:`assign_dip_role`,
:func:`select_offsets`, and :func:`apply_caldip` each raise :class:`NotImplementedError`. The
implementation lands on a separate branch; a reference implementation exists for cross-checking.

Carrier and field contract are fixed by the three-way coordination note
(ctdcast → caldip → oceanarray) and documented for builders in
``docs/source/methods/calibration.rst`` (which owns the correction model and stop-selection
rules). Sign convention: every ``*_diff`` variable is ``instrument − CTD``, so an instrument is
corrected toward the reference by subtracting the offset (``corrected = measured − diff``).
