# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Section manifest — grid registry (rep/06, design §9.2–§9.3, §7)
#
# Declared here per design §9.7: each page's registry lives in its own module.
# Panels wrap the unchanged ``_make_*`` adapters; sections/profiles are the
# declarative layer.  ``GRID_CAPTIONS`` is kept as a panel-id-keyed dict so it
# maps one-to-one onto the future ``oceanarray/config/default.yaml`` ``captions:``
# block (the render adapters and ``applies_to`` predicates are code and stay
# here; only the declarative data — order, titles, captions — migrates to YAML).
# Captions are plain text (Unicode notation, no markup): they become a
# user-editable data field, so they are rendered *escaped*, never ``|safe``.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


#: Panel captions, keyed by panel id (design §6.1: caption strings are a data
#: field, not template prose).  Plain text with Unicode scientific notation — no
#: HTML markup — because a future override layer makes these user-editable YAML,
#: where trusted markup would be an injection vector.  This dict is the in-Python
#: form of ``default.yaml``'s ``captions:`` block; when that lands it is replaced
#: by a YAML load and nothing else here changes.

    The T-S diagram is drawn once, eagerly, by :func:`build_grid_context`: it
    both produces ``ts_bounds`` (consumed by Hydrography, independent of whether
    the T-S *section* is in the profile) and yields ``ts_b64``, which the
    ``ts_diagram`` panel returns directly rather than re-rendering the figure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : xarray.Dataset
        The opened gridded dataset.
    lat : float
        Mooring latitude in degrees; ``0.0`` (with a warning) if unresolved.
    lat_resolved : bool
        Whether ``lat`` came from the file attributes.  ``False`` is a metadata
        defect: the N² panel stubs on it (via ``unavailable_if``), while the
        spectra still compute at ``lat=0`` as before.
    ts_bounds : dict
        Shared T-S axis limits, from :func:`_make_grid_ts_diagram`.
    ts_b64 : str or None
        The rendered T-S diagram (base64 PNG), or ``None`` if it could not be
        drawn.  Cached here so the figure is drawn once, not once for the bounds
        and again for the panel.
    dt_s : float
        Sample interval in seconds.
    history_entries : list
        Parsed processing-history entries (for the history panel).
    nc_meta : dict
        NetCDF metadata (variables/scalars/globals) for the appendix tables.
    nc_file : str
        The gridded NetCDF file's name, for the appendix table heading.
