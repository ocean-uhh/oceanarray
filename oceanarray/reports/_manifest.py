"""Section-manifest model and resolver for report pages.

A report page is described by a :class:`Profile`: an ordered sequence of
:class:`Section` (and :class:`Expand`) entries, each naming :class:`Panel` ids
that render figures or tables.  :func:`resolve` walks a profile once against a
render context and returns a :class:`ResolvedReport` whose sections are numbered
over the *rendered subset* — absent sections leave no gap, and identity is the
section id (a stable slug), not the integer.

This module holds only the model and the resolution algorithm — it is
package-neutral (names no variable, page, or science) and is vendored
byte-identical to the sister repos.  Each page's concrete registry (its
``Ctx`` builder, panels, sections, and profiles) lives in that page's own
module — grid's in ``reports/_grid.py``, and so on — never in a plural
``_manifests.py`` companion.  The design rationale is in
``.claude/notes/2026-08-15-report-section-manifest-design.md``.

class Panel:
    """One figure or table, addressable by id.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id : str
        Unique panel identifier, e.g. ``"temperature_field"``.  Also the anchor
        a caption or cross-reference can point at.
    render : Callable
        Adapter that returns the panel's payload — a base64 PNG string for a
        ``"figure"``, or ready-to-emit markup for ``"html"``/``"table"`` — or
        ``None`` when the panel applies but no output could be produced (a plot
        raised, or the variable is absent), which the resolver turns into a
        ``.warn`` stub.  Figure adapters wrap the existing ``_make_*_b64``
        functions unchanged.
    kind : {"figure", "html", "table"}, optional
        Content discriminator.  The template macro branches on it so that only
        ``"html"``/``"table"`` payloads are emitted ``|safe``; a ``"figure"``
        payload is always escaped into an image ``src``.
    slot : str or Callable, optional
        ``SLOTS`` key giving the panel's display width, or a callable
        ``ctx -> slot`` that computes it (e.g. from a section's aspect ratio).
        Belongs to the panel, not the section, so a panel is the same width
        wherever it is placed.  The resolver calls it when callable.
    caption : str, optional
        Caption text rendered beneath the panel.
    applies_to : Callable, optional
        Predicate deciding whether the panel is attempted at all.  ``False``
        omits the panel silently (it is excluded, not merely unavailable).

    Parameters
    ----------
    id : str
        Unique section identifier, e.g. ``"hydrography"``.  Doubles as the anchor
        and the cross-reference key.
    title : str
        Human-readable heading text (without a number — the number is computed).
    panels : tuple of str
        Panel ids, in display order.
    level : int, optional
        Heading level (``2`` for ``<h2>``).
    intro : str, optional
        Introductory prose rendered under the heading, before the panels.
    applies_to : Callable, optional
        Predicate deciding whether the section is included.  When ``None``
        (default), the section applies if *any* of its panels apply.  A section
        dropped here is named in the report's "not applicable" footer line.
    role : str, optional
        ``"content"`` (numbered ``1..N``) or ``"appendix"`` (numbered ``A..``),
        so appendix material such as a NetCDF-variable table does not pad the
        science numbering.
