# Legacy RODB/RAPID Demo Notebooks

This directory contains demo notebooks for the legacy RODB/RAPID format processing workflow.

**⚠️ These notebooks use deprecated functionality.**

For new projects, use the modern CF-compliant workflow notebooks in the parent directory:
- `demo_stage1.ipynb` - Stage1: Format standardization
- `demo_stage2.ipynb` - Stage2: Clock corrections and trimming  
- `demo_step1.ipynb` - Time gridding and mooring-level processing

## Legacy Notebooks

- `demo_instrument_rdb.ipynb` - Legacy RODB instrument processing
- `demo_mooring_rdb.ipynb` - Legacy RODB mooring processing
- `demo_batch_instrument.ipynb` - Batch processing and QC analysis

These notebooks are maintained for backward compatibility with existing RAPID/RODB datasets but are not recommended for new processing workflows.
