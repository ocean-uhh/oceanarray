Oceanarray: Methods and Workflows for Mooring Array Processing
===============================================================

This repository documents and demonstrates the processing steps required to
convert raw instrument data from oceanographic mooring arrays into scientifically
useful transport and circulation diagnostics such as the meridional overturning
circulation (MOC).

It provides methods, example code, and reference documentation for modular,
reproducible processing pipelines based on multi-mooring observational arrays.

.. warning::

   **Output format is not yet stable.**  Variable names in Stage 1–3, stack, and
   grid NetCDF files are being revised for CF and OceanSITES compliance before the
   1.0 release.  Do not build downstream scripts that depend on specific variable
   names until the renaming audit is complete.  See the :doc:`roadmap` for status.
