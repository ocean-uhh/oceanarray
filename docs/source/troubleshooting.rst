Troubleshooting

This page collects common installation and runtime problems and their solutions.
It was assembled from real installation notes on macOS (Python 3.11, Homebrew).

Installation problems
---------------------

seasenselib dependency conflicts (pyrsktools, pycnv, pyproj)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``seasenselib`` declares version constraints on several packages
(``pyrsktools``, ``pycnv``, ``pyproj``) that can conflict with the rest of the
oceanarray environment when pip tries to resolve everything at once.

The fix is to install those packages first — letting pip satisfy them against
oceanarray's own requirements — then install ``seasenselib`` without its
dependency resolver:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pyrsktools pycnv
   pip install seasenselib --no-deps

This is safe because oceanarray already provides compatible versions of the
packages that ``seasenselib`` needs at runtime.

**If pyproj still fails to install** (some pip versions fail to build it from
source), force a pre-built binary wheel before the step above:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade \
       --force-reinstall \
       --no-cache-dir \
       --only-binary=:all: \
       "pyproj>=3.7.0"

Then re-run the ``pyrsktools``/``pycnv``/``seasenselib`` steps.

If all else fails, recreate the virtual environment with Python 3.11 exactly
(``python3.11 -m venv venv``) and start from scratch.

----

Environment problems
--------------------

Commands not found after closing the terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The virtual environment must be activated in every new terminal session.
If you use a **venv**:

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
   # venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

If you use **conda**:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate oceanarray

If you also use a local shell script to set ``DATA_BASE`` or similar
environment variables, source that too before running ``oceanarray``
commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   source shlocal/run_mooring.sh   # example — path will differ

----

Runtime problems
----------------

``oceanarray`` prints no output / exits silently
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check that the ``--proc-dir`` path exists and that the mooring YAML is
present at ``{proc_dir}/{mooring_name}/{mooring_name}.mooring.yaml``.
Run with ``--verbose`` or ``-v`` for more detail.

Stage 1 fails with "no reader found"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``seasenselib`` is not installed, or the ``file_type:`` field in the mooring
YAML does not match a recognised reader.  Run ``oceanarray list`` to see
accepted ``file_type`` strings.

Stage 3 velocity shows all NaN / coordinate_system is BEAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Nortek Aquadopps the BEAM→ENU transformation requires a transformation
matrix parsed from the ``.hdr`` file.  If the ``.hdr`` file was not found at
stage 1, ``coordinate_system`` is stored as ``"BEAM"`` and stage 3 skips the
rotation.  Verify that the ``.hdr`` file is in the same directory as the
``.aqd`` data file and that the ``header:`` field in the mooring YAML points
to it.

Getting help
------------

If none of the above solves your problem:

* Open an issue at https://github.com/ocean-uhh/oceanarray/issues and include
  the full traceback and the output of ``oceanarray --version``.
* Check that your branch is up to date: ``git pull``.
