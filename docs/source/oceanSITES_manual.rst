1. Overview
===========

1.1 About OceanSITES
---------------------

The OceanSITES programme is the global network of open-ocean sustained time series sites, called ocean reference stations, being implemented by an international partnership of researchers and agencies. OceanSITES provides fixed-point time series of various physical, biogeochemical, ecosystem and atmospheric variables at locations around the globe, from the atmosphere and sea surface to the seafloor. The program's objective is to build and maintain a multidisciplinary global network for a broad range of research and operational applications including climate, carbon, and ecosystem variability and forecasting and ocean state validation.

All OceanSITES data are publicly available. More information about the program is available at: http://www.oceansites.org.

1.2 Broader Context
-------------------

OceanSITES contributes to the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) which are co-sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the International Science Council (ISC). Under the umbrella of the Observations Coordination Group (OCG) of GOOS, OceanSITES observing activities are coordinated with numerous platform-based networks including Argo, GO-SHIP, OceanGliders, and the Data Buoy Cooperation Panel (DBCP), and others. Through OCG a strong link is created to the WMO- IOC Joint Centre for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology Observation Programmes Support (JCOMMOPS), which hosts a metadata base for the OCG ocean observing platforms. In the current revision the OceanSITES metadata conventions seek to accord with or at least to minimize the translations required to allow ingestion of OceanSITES metadata into JCOMMOPS, and thus make OceanSITES more visible and quantifiable in the global context.

.. _oceansites-organizational-model:

1.3 OceanSITES Organizational model
-----------------------------------

OceanSITES is comprised of three organizational units: PIs, DACs, GDACs.

The Principal Investigator (PI), typically a scientist at a research institution, maintains the observing platform and the sensors that deliver the data. He or she is responsible for providing the data and all auxiliary information to a Data Assembly Center (DAC); a PI may also act as a DAC.

The DAC assembles OceanSITES-compliant files from this information and delivers these to the two Global Data Assembly Centers (GDACs), where they are made publicly available.

OceanSITES observing objectives are grouped around core themes. Currently, these themes have been defined:

* **Transport Moored Arrays**: Installations designed to study volume and property transport
* **Air/sea flux reference sites**: Studies of the ocean/atmosphere interface (long time series & boundary layer physics, gas uptake)
* **Global Ocean Watch**: Multidisciplinary long time series at regions considered "representative" for larger areas (biogeochemical provinces, gyres, etc.)
* **Deep-Ocean T/S Challenge**: Platforms collecting deep Ocean observations (below 2000m), especially temperature salinity measurements near the sea floor.

As new themes are developed, they will be incorporated, with coordination between the Science Steering Team and the Project Office.

1.4 About this document
------------------------

The main purpose of this document is to specify the format of the files that are used to distribute OceanSITES data, and to document the standards used therein. This includes naming conventions, or taxonomy, as well as metadata content. Intended users are OceanSITES data providers and users of OceanSITES data.

1.4.1 Technical Documentation available
---------------------------------------

Technical documentation of the OceanSITES system consists of three pieces:

* **OceanSITES Data Format Reference Manual**: This manual.
* **OceanSITES Data Users' Guide**: For data users, formerly called How to Access OceanSITES Data, this document contains an outline of Global Data Assembly Center (GDAC) data directory structure and ftp/opendap access, data use policy/license, list of sites, Data Assembly Centers (DACs), etc. It should be used in conjunction with the Data Format Reference Manual.
* **OceanSITES Data Providers' Guide**: For data producers: DACs and Principal Investigators (PIs), based on the earlier document How to Work with GDAC. This document contains guidelines for providing metadata and data, file naming scheme, and how to upload data to the system. It should be used in conjunction with the Data Format Reference Manual.

1.5 User Obligations
---------------------

An OceanSITES data provider is expected to read and understand this manual and the netCDF specification it describes. OceanSITES participants are required to submit data to the program in a timely fashion, with the understanding that these are the "best available" versions, and may be updated if improved versions become available. Data files should be in compliance with this or an earlier published OceanSITES format specification.

A user of OceanSITES data must comply with the requirements set forth in the attributes "license" and "citation" of the netCDF data files.

Unless stated otherwise, a user must acknowledge use of OceanSITES data in all publications and products where such data are used, preferably with the following standard citation:

"These data were collected and made freely available by the international OceanSITES program and the national programs that contribute to it."

1.6 Disclaimer
--------------

OceanSITES data are published without any warranty, expressed or implied. The user assumes all risk arising from his/her use of OceanSITES data.

OceanSITES data are intended to be research-quality and include estimates of data quality and accuracy, but it is possible that these estimates or the data themselves contain errors. It is the sole responsibility of the user to assess if the data are appropriate for his/her use, and to interpret the data, data quality, and data accuracy accordingly.

1.7 Feedback
------------

OceanSITES welcomes users to ask questions and report problems to the contact addresses listed in the data files or on the OceanSITES web page (projectoffice@oceansites.org).

2. OceanSITES NetCDF Data Format for Primary Observational Data
================================================================

The primary observational data that OceanSITES reports comes from individual deployments of moorings, or sometimes, repeat ship visits. This section describes the data format specifications for data files containing these primary data sets. Data are typically shown at the native instrumental resolution in time and space. For data that merges multiple deployments, as well as derived products, please refer to the later section.

OceanSITES uses netCDF (Network Common Data Form), a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats developed by the Unidata progam at UCAR. Our implementation of netCDF is based on the community-supported Climate and Forecast Metadata Convention (CF), which provides a definitive description of the data in each variable, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. Any version of CF may be used, but it must be identified in the 'Conventions' attribute.

The purpose of the format specification is to make OceanSITES data easy to discover and to interpret and use appropriately. To the extent possible, netCDF files should be self-describing; any relevant metadata should be included whether it is part of the standard or not. For example, water depth, instrumentation descriptions, and detailed provenance are all useful fields and should be included if available.

OceanSITES adds some requirements to the CF standard, including implementing Unidata's netCDF Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD). Further additions are needed for efficient aggregation by the GDACs, for improved access via the JCOMMOPS metadata portal, and to ensure that the data can be created and understood by basic netCDF utilities. Fields required by ACDD, by the GDACs, or by the JCOMMOPS metadata portal are indicated in the table below.

Where time is specified as a string, the ISO8601 standard "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ" is used; this applies to attributes and to the base date in the 'units' attribute for time. There is no default time zone; UTC must be used, and specified.

Global attributes from Unidata's netCDF Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD) are implemented.

Variable names (short names) from a controlled vocabulary are recommended

The components of netCDF files are described in the following sections. In this document, the term 'project' may refer to a single OceanSITES site, or to a group of sites that are managed by a single DAC, or share funding or infrastructure.

2.1 New features in this release
---------------------------------

The global scale and cross network coordination provided by the JCOMMOPS metadata portal requires information not previously defined by the OceanSITES netCDF specification. New fields in this release have been added primarily to provide better conformance with the JCOMMOPS metadata database, and these are identified in their descriptions.

.. _oceansites-global-attributes:

2.2 Global attributes
---------------------

The global attribute section of a netCDF file describes the contents of the file overall, and allows for data discovery. All fields should be human-readable and use units that are easy to understand (e.g. time_coverage_duration should be in days, for a file that spans more than a month). OceanSITES recommends that all of these attributes be used and contain meaningful information, unless there are technical reasons rendering this impossible. Attributes used by our data inventory system are required, and are listed in bold type.

Global attribute names are case sensitive.

Attributes are organized by function: Discovery and identification, Geo-spatial-temporal, Conventions used, Publication information, and Provenance. Attributes that are part of the Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD) or Climate and Forecast (CF) standard, or that appear in the NetCDF Users Guide (NUG) are so indicated, as are those that are used by the OceanSITES Global Data Assembly Center (GDAC) inventory software or the JCOMMOPS metadata database.

**Notes on Global Attributes**

* **Format for date and time attributes**: Use ISO 8601combined date and time representations, and always specify UTC with the trailing 'Z' to avoid any confusion. "2007-04-05T14:30Z"

* **File dates**: The file dates, date_created and date_modified, are our interpretation of the file dates as defined by ACDD. Date_created is the time stamp on the file, date_modified may be used to represent the 'version date' of the geophysical data in the file. The date_created may change when e.g. metadata is added or the file format is updated, and the optional date_modified MAY be earlier.

* **Geospatial extents**: (geospatial_lat_min, max, and lon_min, max) are preferred to be stored as strings for use in the GDAC software, however numeric fields are acceptable. This information is linked to the site information, and may not be specific to the platform deployment.

* **cdm_data_type**: is acceptable in any file; the use of a featureType attribute indicates that this is a Discrete Sampling Geometry file that adheres to rules for such files, including some contraints on acceptable coordinate variables; see CF Documentation.

* **Note on ExpoCodes**: The ExpoCode is generated using the 4 character ICES platform code followed by the cruise departure date (YYYYMMDD format). Example: US research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer (ICES ship code: 3206), starting on 2011-02-19: 320620110219

2.3 Dimensions
--------------

NetCDF dimensions provide information on the size of the data variables, and additionally tie coordinate variables to data. CF recommends that if any or all of the dimensions of a variable have the interpretations of "date or time" (T), "height or depth" (Z), "latitude" (Y), or "longitude" (X) then those dimensions should appear in the relative order T, Z, Y, X in the variable's definition (in the CDL).

**Notes on Dimensions**

CF v 1.5 introduced Discrete Sampling Geometries; these are permitted in OceanSITES but are not described in this manual; they may require different sets of dimensions from those documented here. Please see Chapter 9. Discrete Sampling Geometries of the CF Conventions document, http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#discrete-sampling-geometries, for details.

.. _oceansites-coordinates:

2.4 Coordinate variables
------------------------

NetCDF coordinates are a special subset of variables. Coordinate variables orient the data in time and space; they may be dimension variables or auxiliary coordinate variables (identified by the 'coordinates' attribute on a data variable). Coordinate variables have an "axis" attribute defining that they represent the X, Y, Z, or T axis.

As with data variables, OceanSITES recommends variable names and requires specific attributes for coordinate variables: units, axis, and, where available, standard_name are required. Missing values are not allowed in coordinate variables.

All attributes in this section are highly recommended. The attribute "QC_indicator" may be omitted for any parameter if there is a separate QC variable for that parameter.

       <Y>: Text from reference table 3.

**Notes on coordinate variables**

**Time:** By default, the time word represents the center of the data sample or averaging period. The base date in the 'units' attribute for time is represented in ISO8601 standard "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ"; note that UTC (Z) must be explicitly specified. This requirement is an extension to ISO8601.

**DEPTH:** The depth variable may be positive in either upward or downward direction, which is defined in its "positive" attribute. The Z axis may be represented as pressure, if, for example pressure is recorded directly by an instrument and the calculation of depth from pressure would cause a loss of information. Depth is strongly preferred, since it allows data to be used more directly. Meteorological data should include a HEIGHT coordinate that is otherwise identical to DEPTH.

The default depth reference is "sea_level" (free sea surface). In EPSG coordinate reference system, the default reference for DEPTH is: "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::5831" and for HEIGHT: "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::5829".

The latitude and longitude datum is WGS84. This is the default output of GPS systems.

Many coordinate variables for ocean data are nominal; an anchor position, or a vertical position on a mooring chain. When there is supplemental data, like a GPS time series or a pressure measurement from one instrument, it may be provided as a data variable, and may be given an 'axis' attribute, but does not need to be specified as a coordinate.

2.5 Data variables
------------------

Data variables contain the actual measurements and information about their quality, uncertainty, and mode by which they were obtained. Different options for how quality indicators are specified are outlined in the notes below the table.

Recommended variable names are listed in Reference Table 6; replace <PARAM> with any of the names indicated there. Required attributes are marked as such, however, OceanSITES requests that all other attributes be used and contain meaningful information, unless technical reasons make this impossible.

* <A>: standardized attributes listed in reference tables
* <B>: attributes whose values are set following OceanSITES rules
* <C>: attributes whose value is free text, set by the data provider

       **sensor_data_file_DOI:** if a DOI for the sensor data exists it should be provided here. Use a comma-separated list if needed.

**Notes on data variables**

**The 'coordinates' attribute:**

There are two methods used to locate data in time and space. The preferred method is for the data variable to be declared with dimensions that are coordinate variables, e.g. ATMP(TIME, DEPTH, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE). Alternatively, a variable may be declared with fewer dimensions, e.g. ATMP(TIME). In the latter case, the 'coordinates' attribute of the variable provides the spatiotemporal reference for the data. The value of the coordinates attribute is a blank separated list of the names of auxiliary coordinate variables; these must exist in the file, and their sizes must match a subset of the data variable's dimensions; scalar coordinates do so by default.

The use of coordinate variables as dimensions is preferred, because it conforms to COARDS and because it simplifies the use of the data by standard software. Note that it is permissible, but optional, to list coordinate variables as well as auxiliary coordinate variables in the coordinates attribute.

**Sensor/instrument metadata:**

Complete information about the instrument or the sensor should be provided by one of two methods, which are outlined in Appendix 2. Fields should include model name, manufacturer, serial number, the device code from the SeaVoX L22 vocabulary, and a URL or reference that points to an instrument's specifications. This information may be presented in a series of attributes attached to a data variable, or via a single 'instrument' attribute. The 'instrument' attribute points to a group of variables that contain the description of the sensors; the latter method allows two-dimensional information when different instruments measure the same data variable, and avoids repetition of information for instruments that measure multiple variables.

**Date/time attribute format:**

Format for date and time attributes: Use ISO 8601combined date and time representations, and always specify UTC with the trailing 'Z' to avoid any confusion. "2007-04-05T14:30Z"

**Uncertainty, Accuracy, Precision, terms:**

Accuracy is the closeness of the variable to the actual value; precision is the repeatability of the measurement, and resolution is the fineness to which the value can be displayed. Uncertainty combines accuracy and precision and is not to be confused with the sensor accuracy given by a manufacturer. These terms may be provided as attributes to the target data variables if they are constant over the dataset, or may be provided as ancillary variables if they change over depth or time.

2.6 Quality control variables
-----------------------------

Data quality and provenance information for both coordinate variables and data variables is needed. If the quality control values are constant across all dimensions of a variable, the information may be given as text attributes of that variable; if they vary along one or more axes, they are provided as a separate numeric flag variable, with at least one dimension that matches the 'target' variable.

When QC information is provided as a separate flag variable, CF requires that these variables carry attributes 'flag_values' and 'flag_meanings'. These provide a list of possible values and their meanings. When this information is provided in the attributes of the target variables, it should be given in a human-readable form.

Description of QC attributes is provided above in the sections on data variables and coordinates. Below is a description of how to provide this information as a separate variable. Examples are given for coordinate and data variables; data variables are identified by the term <param> which represents a name from our list of variable names.

3. Reference tables
===================

3.1 Reference table 1: data_type
---------------------------------

The data_type global attribute should have one of the valid values listed here.

.. list-table:: Data Type Values
   :widths: 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Data type
   * - OceanSITES profile data
   * - OceanSITES time-series data
   * - OceanSITES trajectory data

3.2 Reference table 2: QC_indicator
------------------------------------

The quality control flags indicate the data quality of the data values in a file. The byte codes in column 1 are used only in the <PARAM>_QC variables to describe the quality of each measurement, the strings in column 2 ('meaning') are used in the attribute <PARAM>:QC_indicator to describe the overall quality of the parameter.

When the numeric codes are used, the flag_values and flag_meanings attributes are required and should contain lists of the codes (comma-separated) and their meanings (space separated, replacing spaces within each meaning by '_').

.. _oceansites-processing-levels:

3.3 Reference table 3: Processing level
----------------------------------------

This table describes the quality control and other processing procedures applied to all the measurements of a variable. The string values are used as an overall indicator (i.e. one summarizing all measurements) in the attributes of each variable in the processing_level attribute.

   * - Instrument data that has been converted to geophysical values
   * - Post-recovery calibrations have been applied
   * - Data has been scaled using contextual information
   * - Known bad data has been replaced with null values
   * - Known bad data has been replaced with values based on surrounding data
   * - Ranges applied, bad data flagged
   * - Data interpolated

3.4 Reference table 4: Data mode
---------------------------------

The values for the variables "<PARAM>_DM", the global attribute "data_mode", and variable attributes "<PARAM>:DM_indicator" are defined as follows:

.. list-table:: Data Mode Values
   :widths: 10 20 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Value
     - Meaning
     - Description
   * - R
     - Real-time data
     - Data coming from the (typically remote) platform through a communication channel without physical access to the instruments, disassembly or recovery of the platform. Example: for a mooring with a radio communication, this would be data obtained through the radio.
   * - P
     - Provisional data
     - Data obtained after instruments have been recovered or serviced; some calibrations or editing may have been done, but the data is not thought to be fully processed. Refer to the history attribute for more detailed information.
   * - D
     - Delayed-mode data
     - Data published after all calibrations and quality control procedures have been applied on the internally recorded or best available original data. This is the best possible version of processed data.
   * - M
     - Mixed
     - This value is only allowed in the global attribute "data_mode" or in attributes to variables in the form "<PARAM>:DM_indicator". It indicates that the file contains data in more than one of the above states. In this case, the variable(s) <PARAM>_DM specify which data is in which data mode.

3.6 Reference table 6: Identifying data variables
--------------------------------------------------

When an appropriate CF standard name is available, it is required to be used in the standard_name attribute; if no such name exists in the CF standard, this attribute should not be used. In those cases, we have recommended terms to be used in the long_name attribute, as well as 'short names' or variable names. Standard names in the table below are in bold; recommended long names are not. Please refer to the CF Standard Names table on line for authoritative information (definitions, canonical units) on standard names.

It is recommended that variable names start with a code based on SeaDataNet parameter discovery vocabulary, P02. They are not strictly standardized, however; one should use the CF standard_name attribute to query data files. Note that a single standard name may be used more than once in a file, but short names must be unique.

For example, if sea temperature on a mooring is measured by a series of 5 Microcats and by a profiler that produces values at 10 levels, it may be reported in a single file with 2 temperature variables and 2 depth variables. TEMP(TIME, DEPTH) could hold the Microcat data, if DEPTH is declared as a 5-element coordinate; and TEMP_prof(TIME, DEPTH_prof) could hold the profiler data if DEPTH_prof is declared as a 10-element coordinate. Both variables would have a standard_name of "sea_water_temperature". The following lists a subset of the OceanSITES recommended variable names.

4. Data Files
=============

4.1 Deployment Data Files
--------------------------

Deployment data files contain data from a single deployment of a platform, and normally hold one type of data; meteorology, salinity, or currents, for example. These files are stored in the directory /DATA/[SiteCode] on the OceanSITES GDAC servers.

.. _oceansites-file-naming:

4.1.1 Deployment Data files Naming Convention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The deployment data files are named using this convention:

**OS_[PlatformCode]_[DeploymentCode]_[DataMode]_[PARTX].nc**

* **OS** - OceanSITES prefix
* **[PlatformCode]** - Platform code from the OceanSITES catalogue
* **[DeploymentCode]** - Deployment code (unique code for deployment - date or number)
* **[DataMode]** - Data Mode

  * **R**: real-time data
  * **P**: provisional data
  * **D**: delayed mode data
  * **M**: mixed delayed mode and real-time data

* **[PARTX]** - An optional user-defined field for identification of data

**Remark:** the field separator in the file name is "_". This character must not be used in any of the file name's fields.

**Example:** /DATA/CIS/OS_CIS-1_200905_R_CTD.nc

This file contains temperature and salinity data from the CIS-1 platform, from the May 2009 deployment.

4.2 Merged, Gridded and Derived Data Files
--------------------------------------------

Building on the individual observations at an OceanSITES site or from an array of OceanSITES sites, a number of higher-level data products can be created:

* A "long time series" version that may simply concatenate multiple deployments into one data file/product for ease of use, but without significant changes to the content of the data from the individual deployment-by-deployment data. The concatenated data will in many cases combine observational data time series acquired at different instrument heights and as such further processing and homogenization may be required.

* A "gridded" version that presents time series created from observational data of single or multiple instruments but interpolated to a space-time grid different from the native instrumental resolution, e.g. by averaging or interpolating the data along one of the coordinate axes;

* "Derived" data products that are computed from the observational data, possibly from one or multiple sites and/or instruments, which contain parameters that are not directly observed, but rather involve some higher-order computations or models in their generation. Informative documented of the computations used, in either a technical document or a publication, is highly recommended by OceanSITES.

These are not mutually exclusive, and the decision whether to declare a data product as one versus another option rests with the PIs. It is understood that when multiple data files are aggregated, the metadata attributes may not contain all the detailed information of each individual source data file; please refer to the deployment files for complete metadata.

Data in any of these higher-level files are duplicates of the deployment file data, and data aggregation processes should be careful to treat it as such.

4.2.1 Merged, Gridded and Derived Data File Metadata Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OceanSITES recognizes that individual research projects generate different, if any, higher-level data products, and there is no particular set of metadata fields that covers all cases. Therefore, the format specifications of these higher-level data files are only loosely defined as follows:

The file format for the higher-level data is netCDF. Each file is compliant with the following conventions:

* **CF metadata conventions**: Standard names for data variables are required when available, and all other CF conventions should be used when possible.
* **Unidata Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD)**
* **Additional metadata attributes** from the deployment-by-deployment files (as specified earlier in this document) are possible and welcome, as long as they make sense for the data product in question.

The files should contain a list in the metadata that explains what lower-level files they were derived from, including the version of the original data files. This can be done through the global attributes "history" or "comment".

For gridded data and derived products, data quality information (such as QC flags) is not strictly required. It is understood that during the gridding and processing, only good source data was used.

Likewise, information on data mode (delayed-mode versus real-time) is not strictly required for gridded data or derived products. The default assumption is that the best available version was used, and that the metadata records provides a reasonable backtrace to the underlying source data and to the processes used.

4.2.2 Merged, Gridded or Product Data File Naming Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The file names of the original deployment-by-deployment files are encoded as follows (see earlier sections of this document):

**OS_[PlatformCode]_[DeploymentCode]_[DataMode]_[PARTX].nc**

The file names for the higher-level products have a similar structure, with the following modifications:

* Instead of the [DataMode], a code is inserted that defines the type of data,
* Instead of the [DeploymentCode], a time range is used by default,
* For data from multiple platforms/sites, [PlatformCode] can be replaced with appropriate choices of site, project, array, or network, which are taken from the global attributes of the underlying source data.

The higher-level data files follow this naming convention:

**OS_[PSPANCode]_[StartEndCode]_[ContentType]_[PARTX].nc**

* **OS** - OceanSITES prefix
* **[PSPANCode]** - Deployment, platform, site, project, array, or network code from the underlying source data files. If all data are from one deployment of one platform, the platform and deployment code should be used. Else, move down the sequence terms until one is found that is unique and appropriate for all data in the file.
* **[StartEndCode]** - A code that describes the time range of the data in the file. Preferred format is e.g. "20050301-20190831" to indicate data from March 2005 through August 2019. Alternatively, if all data are from a single platform, a range of deployment codes can be used (e.g. "01-14" to indicate data from the first through the 14th deployment of this platform).
* **[ContentType]** - A three-letter code that describes the content of the file (distinguished from the deployment files, which have a one-letter code here), one of:

  * **LTS**: The data are "long time series" data that are essentially at the native instrumental resolution in space and time. The primary difference from the deployment-by-deployment files is that a single file contains merged data from multiple deployments.
  * **GRD**: The data are "gridded", meaning that some sort of binning, averaging, interpolating has been done to format the data onto a space-time grid that is different from the native resolution, and more than a simple concatenation like the "LTS" option.
  * **DPR**: The data are a "derived product", which means that there are data that were derived from multiple sites or some other higher-order processing that the data provider distinguishes from the lower-level data.

* **[PARTX]** - An optional user-defined field for additional identification or explanation of data. For gridded data, this could include the record interval as subfields of ISO 8601 (PnYnMnDTnHnMnS), e.g. P1M for monthly data, T30M for 30 minutes, T1H for hourly.

4.2.3 Higher-Level File Locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The higher-level data files are found in the GDAC under the directory **/DATA_GRIDDED/**

To clarify that this includes the long time series and derived products, there are symbolic links called "long_timeseries" and "derived_products" that point back to this directory.

Inside the DATA_GRIDDED directories, there are subdirectories that contain the data files. The names of the subdirectories are either site, array, or network names as defined in the metadata of the underlying files. These do not provide a unique place for a given file; data providers work with the GDAC to identify the preferred location to be used.

5. OceanSITES Data Management topics
=====================================

The GDACs distribute the best copy of the data files, which means that, if a higher quality data file (e.g. improved calibrated data) is available, it replaces the previous version of the data file. The data file version is indicated in the netCDF fields.

OceanSITES does not archive data; archive will be implemented by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, formerly the National Ocean Data Center, or NODC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the USA. Correct use of our documented data format specification is critical to the archive process.

5.1 Global Data Assembly Centers
---------------------------------

Two global data assembly centers (GDACs) provide access points for OceanSITES data. One is in France at Coriolis, Ifremer (http://www.coriolis.eu.org), the other is in the US at NOAA's National Data Buoy Center (NDBC , http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov).

The servers at the GDACs are synchronized at least daily to provide the same OceanSITES data redundantly.

The user can access the data at either GDAC's ftp site:

* ftp://data.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/oceansites
* ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/oceansites

Deployment data is organized by site and by resource type in the GDACs' DATA directories:

**DATA/site/FileName.nc** where site is the OceanSITES site code.

For information on uploading data, please see the Data Providers' Guide.

5.2 Index file: GDAC data inventory
------------------------------------

To allow for data discovery without downloading the data files themselves, an 'index file' is created by each of the GDACs. The index file is a comma-separated-values text file named **oceansites_index.txt**, in the root directory of each GDAC. It contains a list of the files on the server, and metadata extracted from those files.

The file contains a header section, lines of which start with # characters, the list of all data files available on the GDAC, and their descriptions.

Each line contains the following information:

* **file**: the file name, beginning from the GDAC root directory
* **date_update**: the update date of the file, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SSZ
* **start_date**: first date for observations, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SSZ
* **end_date**: last date for observations, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SSZ
* **southern_most_latitude**
* **northern_most_latitude**
* **western_most_longitude**
* **eastern_most_longitude**
* **geospatial_vertical_min**
* **geospatial_vertical_min**
* **update_interval**: M monthly, D daily, Y yearly, V void
* **size**: the size of the file in megabytes
* **gdac_creation_date**: date of creation of the file on the GDAC
* **gdac_update_date**: date of update of the file on the GDAC.
* **data_mode**: R, P, D, M (real-time, provisional, delayed mode, mixed; see reference table 5)
* **parameters**: list of parameters (standard_name) available in the file separated with blank

The fill value is empty: ",,".

5.3 Sensor and instrument metadata
-----------------------------------

There are two methods for providing complete sensor metadata. In method 1, the variable attribute 'instrument' points to an umbrella variable that describes an instrument and its sensor suite; the instrument variable ties one or more instruments to one or more data variables.

Instrument variables may include manufacturer, model, serial number, the SeaVoX L22 code for the instrument, a reference URL that points to a web resource describing the sensor, sensor mount and orientation. Orientation may not be needed for all variables, but is highly recommended for optical instruments, current meters and profilers.

**Method 1 example:**

.. code-block:: none

    variables:
    double TEMP(TIME, DEPTH) ;
    TEMP:instrument = "T_INST" ;
    double PSAL(TIME, DEPTH) ;
    PSAL:instrument = "T_INST" ;
    int T_INST ;
    T_INST:long_name = "instruments" ;
    T_INST:ancillary_variables = "T_INST_MFGR T_INST_MOD T_INST_SeaVoX_L22_code T_INST_SN T_INST_URL T_INST_MOUNT T_INST_CODE" ;
    char T_INST_MFGR(DEPTH, strlen1) ;
    T_INST_MFGR:long_name = "instrument manufacturer" ;
    char T_INST_MODEL(DEPTH, strlen2) ;
    T_INST_MODEL:long_name = "instrument model name" ;
    char T_INST_SeaVoX_L22_code (DEPTH, strlen3) ;
    T_INST_SeaVoX_L22_code:long_name = "SeaVox Vocabulary L22 code" ;
    int T_INST_SN(DEPTH) ;
    T_INST_SN:long_name = "instrument serial number" ;

6.2 Appendix 2: Glossary
-------------------------

This chapter gives a definition for the OceanSITES items described in this manual.

**Site**

An OceanSITES site is a defined geographic location where sustained oceanographic, meteorological or other observations are made. Example: CIS is a site in the Central Irminger Sea.

Note: A site should be thought of as a point in space, i.e. a nominal position, with a small area extent around it, such that successive observations from anywhere within this area reasonably represent conditions at the nominal position for the major scientific questions that the observations address.

**Project**

A project within the OceanSITES program is a scientific research and observing effort. It may consist of a single platform at a single site, or may include multiple sites and platforms, led by one or more principal investigators.

**Array**

An OceanSITES array is a grouping of sites based on a common and identified scientific question, or on a common geographic location.

Example: An IRMINGERSEA array would identify the sites CIS, LOCO-IRMINGERSEA, and OOI-IRMINGERSEA as sharing a common scientific interest and/or geographic location. Other prominent examples are OSNAP, RAPID or the TAO array.

Notes: It is valid for a single site to belong to no, one, or multiple arrays. Documenting the array is recommended only if it identifies commonalities beyond a single project or a single operating institution.

**Network**

An OceanSITES network is a grouping of sites based on common shore-based logistics or infrastructure.

Example: EuroSITES, although technically a single project, bundles multiple institutional efforts and connects otherwise remote sites to a degree that warrants calling it a network.

Notes: It is valid for a single site to belong to no, one, or multiple networks. Documenting the network is recommended only if it identifies structures beyond a single project or a single operating institution.

**Platform**

An OceanSITES platform is an independently deployable package of instruments and sensors forming part of site. It may be fixed to the ocean floor, may float or may be self-propelled.

Examples: 'CIS-1' and 'CIS-2' are surface buoys in the Central Irminger Sea, deployed concurrently. 'THETYS II' is a vessel that performs regular CTDs at DYFAMED site.

**Deployment**

An OceanSITES deployment is an instrumented platform performing observations for a period of time. Changes to the instrumentation or to the spatial characteristics of the platform or its instruments constitute the end of the deployment.

Examples: The CIS-1 deployment performed in May 2009 (200905) is identified as OS_CIS-1_200905. CTD data from this deployment would be distributed in a file called OS_CIS-1_200905_R_CTD.nc.
